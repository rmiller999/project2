# Project 2

This second project is my first foray into building a full-stack application. I have built a Node app, which means that I learned about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up myself.

## Technical Requirements

* Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) -- ideally a user model and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
* Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow
* Incorporate at least one API. Examples include Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data
Include a readme file that explains how to use your app
* Have semantically clean HTML, CSS, and back-end code
Be deployed online and accessible to the public

## Motivation
My motivation behind making this app is that I wanted to make something I thought that I would use.

## What is it?
My app is game search database where users can login and search games they either want to play or have played and add them to a favorites list to keep or remove certain games from that list. 

## Struggles
Some struggles that I went through were trying to get my api to work the way I wanted to.  This was difficult because the api was different then any api that I had work with before so accessing certain information was challenging to figure put.
